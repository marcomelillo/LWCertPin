Lightweight Certificate Pinning with Worklight 6.0

The “man in the middle” attack is a security concern for mobile and web applications in general. 
Applications such as mobile banking manage and send over the net private information that could be easily stolen if such attack is exploited. 
Certificate Pinning is a technique that enforces the control over the authenticity and signature of the server 
certificates used by the application to establish SSL connections. 
This project proposes a programmatic approach to verifying that the application is using the intended certificate leveraging the repackaging controls provided by Worklight.
